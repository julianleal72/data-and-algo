// Given the head of a singly linked list, group all the nodes with odd indices together followed by the nodes with even indices, and return the reordered list.
// The first node is considered odd, and the second node is even, and so on.
// Note that the relative order inside both the even and odd groups should remain as it was in the input.
// You must solve the problem in O(1) extra space complexity and O(n) time complexity.

// Example:
// Input: head = [2,1,3,5,6,4,7]
// Output: [2,3,6,7,1,5,4]
